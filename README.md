# buoy-data-analysis

In this report, the data collected by a single weather buoy in the NOAA National Data Buoy Center is been studyed in order to find any evidence of global warming.

Two variables are mainly considered in this project:
+ ATMP (Air Temperature)
+ WTMP (Water Temperature)

The yearly and monthly average ATMP and WTMP are been calculated to find the trends of temperature according to time.

The plot of trends shows the ATMP and WTMP more or less remain the same for the recent years, and the result of statistical models such as linear regression and Pearson's correlation test also shows there exists NO significant evidence of global warming.
